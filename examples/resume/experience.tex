      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {\textbf{Architected and delivered a low-latency (6s) real-time video streaming platform} for remote ROV seabed pipeline inspections, leveraging \textbf{AWS Elemental (MediaLive, MediaStore), CloudFront (signed cookies), React/Material UI, and a TypeScript/DynamoDB user management backend}. Spearheaded CI/CD automation via AWS CDK.}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item {Engineered the complete user experience, developing the video streaming front-end (React, Material UI) and a full-stack administration system for client channel and user management.}
            \item {Architected the core cloud infrastructure using AWS Elemental MediaLive and built a fully automated CI/CD deployment pipeline with AWS CDK, ensuring scalable and reliable delivery.}
          \end{itemize}
        \item {\textbf{Cloud \& Full-Stack Development:} Architected and deployed a variety of scalable systems on AWS, including a data exchange for Uncrewed Surface Vessels (USVs) and a marine vessel reporting website. Leveraged a broad range of technologies including .NET Core, TypeScript, Docker, and AWS services (Lambda, ECS/Fargate, S3, DynamoDB).}
        \item {\textbf{DevOps \& Infrastructure Automation:} Established and maintained robust CI/CD pipelines across multiple projects using Jenkins and GitHub Actions. Championed Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform and CloudFormation to ensure rapid, reliable, and repeatable deployments.}
        \item {\textbf{Data Processing \& Machine Learning:} Contributed to a cloud-hosted Machine Learning system for the automated classification of multibeam sonar data. Streamlined and automated complex data processing workflows for vessel-based pipe inspections, significantly reducing manual effort.}
        \item {\textbf{System Modernisation \& Core Systems:} Led a team in refactoring monolithic applications into a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), enhancing scalability. Architected and maintained core modules for Fugro's next-generation global data acquisition software suite using .NET and WPF.}
        \item {\textbf{Foundational Engineering:} Built a strong career foundation as a junior engineer, contributing to all aspects of the in-house survey software suite, including data acquisition, processing, and visualisation using C++, MFC, and C\#.}

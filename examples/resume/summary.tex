Senior Software Engineer with over 18 years of hands‑on experience across full‑stack development, cloud infrastructure, and system integration. I specialize in building robust, scalable applications and automating deployment pipelines using modern DevOps tools and practices. A long‑time Vim enthusiast, I enjoy working in terminal‑based environments and continuously refine my toolchain to boost efficiency and focus.

I’m passionate about solving complex technical challenges and constantly exploring new technologies and development techniques. While my primary focus remains software engineering, I’m increasingly contributing to architectural discussions and system design, aiming to grow into broader technical leadership over time.
